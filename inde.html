So now doctrine is defined as a basic one in Islam. The incapacity of common people to perform Ijtihad after the era of companions (Sahaba) make doctrines necessary to keep the people unmistaken ,as Sultan Mansoor ordered Malik(r) to organize the rulings.</p><p>Most of these schools were emerged in ninth and tenth century, later they shrunk into four doctrines-Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, Hambali-and the all other schools became irrelevant. Efforts of disciples and followers made those schools existed and there were more written tretails in those four doctrines, when some were not written at all and some coincided by the lack of followers.</p><p>This research reflects about the doctrines which is timed out very early, when some are trying to emulate this now, as well all its founder-Dawud Zahir-,his disciples such as Abd Allah al-Qaysi and Muhammad bin Dawud al-Zahiri  ,followers such as Ibn Hazm and his ideology on this school, but mainly this research is foccused on its collapse,which had eligibility to go on as the fifth school and the neglects faced in its history and the views of Sunnis and other sects of Islam such shiya etc.</p><p>Once Zahiri was the major school and encompassed Mesopotamia, the Iberian Peninsula, the Balearic Islands, North Africa and Southern Iran and the doctrine was influenced among the Muslims such as others and especially among the Spanish scholars. Ẓāhirī School enjoyed its widest expansion and prestige in the fourth Islamic century especially by the works of Ibn al-Mughallis. At fifth century Zahiri doctrine extinct from Baghdad and subsided in the some parts of Shiraz and Egypt.</p><p>Finally the research defines the relevance of the doctrine and its acceptance to be emulated now, when some are emulating the doctrine of Dawud Zahiri, and ,as a research supporting Ahlu Sunna, this explains the reason of the irrelevance of  this doctrine and the acceptance of only four schools  at Sunni scholars</p><p><a id="_heading=h.gjdgxs"></a>1.2. STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</p><p>According to the order of Sunnies, there are only four doctrines are accepted to be emulated ,as mentioned in the introduction ,But now some are emulating the doctrine all over the world. The researcher understood that as the Madhhab comes under Ahlu_sunnah ,the view of Sunni  scholars about the Madhhab is  must be studied.As well as this Madhhab ,its founder Dawd Al-zahiri and his ideology were not discussed more in the history of Islamic doctrines .And so there are so many doubts to be resolved about the doctrine ,as the histories reflects the books of Ibn_Hazm<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-0" id="footnote-ref-0">[1]</a></sup></sup>  was lighten up by Spainish rulers<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[2]</a></sup></sup>.Here the researcher is trying to resolve those problems by the research</p><p><a id="_heading=h.1t3h5sf"></a>1.3. RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p><p>Who is Dawud Zahiri and who were his followers and disciples?</p><p>What are the Views, Ideologies and the methodologies of performing Ijthihad in Zahiri School?</p><p>Why Zahiri is not eligible to be emulated among Sunni scholars?</p><p>How Zahiri doctrine got irrelevant?</p><p><a id="_heading=h.30j0zll"></a>1.4. RESEARCH OBJECTIVES</p><p>To introduce Dawud Zahiri and his doctrine along detailing his disciples and followers who helped to establish and spread the school.</p><p>To explain Views, Ideologies and the methodology of Analogy (Qiyas) in Zahiri doctrine.</p><p>To decribe the reasons of Zahiri’s failure to be considered as one of Sunni Madhab.</p><p>To explain the reason of the collapse of Zahiri doctrine.</p><p><a id="_heading=h.1fob9te"></a>1.5. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESEARCH</p><p>Zahiri is the fifth school of thought in Sunni Islam. The emerging of a school wants more efforts from its beginning, as its foundation, spreading, and there have to be done more researches in the doctrine in order to develop in the school .Etc. Then the collapse of a doctrine, which had crossed those milestones, is a serious matter according to Islam. Here the collapse of Zahiri doctrine, even after  its members at the end of 10th century were appointed as qadis in Baghdad, Shiraz, Isfahan, Firuzabad, Ramla, Damascus, Fustat, and Bukhara<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[3]</a></sup></sup>,and its irrelevance among the Sunni scholars is a serious one. So the study of their history and the reasons of Sunni scholars are relevant too and significant.</p><p><a id="_heading=h.4d34og8"></a>1.6. SCOPE AND LIMITATION</p><p>The study is to reflect the reasons on the irrelevance of Zahiri doctrine among school of jurispudence. The researcher wants to include something to reach the purpose such his<sup> </sup>and his discipline’s history, description on school of thoughts. So the research is limited on the thoughts and views of Dawud Al-Zahiri- There is no more discussion on his biography. This involves views of Ahlu_Sunnah on emulation, causes of collapse, views of other sects on the doctrine and a short description on his followers. And the study lacked from the history of his followers and disciples despite of a short description.</p><p><a id="_heading=h.3znysh7"></a>1.7. METHODOLOGY</p><p>In order to make a study of reason of Sunni scholars on Zahiri school of thought, the researcher prefers the qualitative method of study based on library research. The data is collected from secondary sources with special priority to classical texts. For data collection, the researcher will depend on the books, journals, articles, theses and other reliable sources.</p><p><a id="_heading=h.2et92p0"></a>1.8. LITERATURE REVIEW</p><p>According to my limited knowledge there are a lot of books referring to the history of Zahiri scholars and followers such as Al-Bidayathu Wan Nihayah of Ibn-Kathir and Thareeq Al Thwabri.The Zahris of Dr. Ignaz Goldziher is discussed about  the doctrine, focusing on the intellectual clashes between supporters of opinion and supporters of Hadees.Tareeq Mazahibul Islamiyya of Abu Zahra includes historical  description of Zahiries. This study will deal about the doctrine’s relevance at the day in the views of Sunni scholars.</p><p><a id="_heading=h.2s8eyo1"></a>1.8. ORGANIZATION OF STUDY</p><p>The first chapter describes the emergence of Zahiri doctrine and their Methodologies. The second chapter describes the biography of Dawud Al-Zahir and his followers such as Ibnu Hazm and in the third chapter describes the collapse of Zahiri doctrine and its causes as well as the views of Sunni scholars and their reasons in the irrelevance of the doctrine.</p><p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p><p><a id="_heading=h.17dp8vu"></a>ZAHIRI DOCTRINE: EMERGING AND METHODOLOGIES</p><p><a id="_heading=h.3rdcrjn"></a>2.1 INDRODUCTION</p><p>The school takes clear injections from Quran and Sunnah as source of Islamic jurisprudence, in which they aren’t considering opinions and logic in legal decisions which is founded by Dawud Al zahiri at ninth century. There is no circumstantial analogy (Qiyas), Juristic preference (Isthihsan) and Malaha Mursala in their evidence of legitimacy. According to other schools some are regarding opinions more as schools of Kufa especially Hanafi and Thouri schools as well as some are upholding the both such as Shafie Laithi  and Awza’i schools .Most of Zairians were Shafies basically, as Imam Shafie opposed whom supports Isthihsan<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3">[4]</a></sup></sup>.</p><p>After it was founded at Iraq successfully and spreaded until their members were appoinded as Qadies in Baghdad, Shiraz, Isfahan, Firuzabad, Ramla, Damascus,Fustat, and Bukhara by the end of 10<sup>th</sup> century<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4">[5]</a></sup></sup>. When it was declined in Middle East, the school flourished in Andhulus particularly under the leadership of Ibn Hazm. Though, the school was successes by two eminent scholars Dawud Al Zahiri and his follower at Andulus Ibn Hazm.</p><p>The emergence of the doctrine and its methodologies  have to be denoted as an introduction to the paper deals the decline of the doctrine and its reasons with the views of Ahlu Sunnah scholars on it. The first part of the chapter goes on dealing with its historical aspects of the school including its background which was founded, foundation, spreading, and the arrival at Islamic Spain. Secondly, their methodologies and stand on performing Ijthihad on the jurisprudent rulings as they are opposing the other four schools.</p><p><a id="_heading=h.26in1rg"></a>2.2 BACKGROUND</p><p>The intellectual struggle between those who upheld the authority of Tradition in all matters of theology and jurisprudence, and those who advocated opinion since second-eighth century gave many priceless contributions to Islamic theology and jurisprudence. The people of Hijaz, particularly those from Madeena supported the authority of tradition. By the establishment of Abbasid Caliphate at Iraq where, those people were supporting opinion, they considered opinion in jurisprudent laws. The upholders of opinion didn’t ignore the traditionalists but they respected the each view of others.</p><p>At the same time there began a movement also by Shiites named as Bathiniyya, who seeks of the spiritual and inner interpretation of revelation<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5">[6]</a></sup></sup>.Bathiniyya took this name from their belief that every Zahir (apparent state of a thing) have a Bathin (a hidden or secret meaning) especially in revelation<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6">[7]</a></sup></sup>. They adopted some from Greek philosophy to attain the hidden meanings of revelation.</p><p>At the age of Abbasi Chaliph Ma’moon(813-833) Bathiniyya movement became stronger. Within a half century it spread over Iraq, Persia, Sind, Oman and North Africa widely.</p><p>Totally the second-eighth century was a mysterious as the scholars of age was forced to deal with a lot of ambiguous problems and to get in a solution when philosophy and other kind science were brought into Islamic world. Philosophical thoughts began to get out the people from real path as Bathiniyyas and Mu’thazilians tried to mix up philosophy with Islamic theology to state their arguments in theology. This made the Ahlu Sunnah scholars to forced to deal with philosophy and logic to encounter other sects Islam while, good predecessors (Salf-Al-Salih) are opposing to refer such books<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7">[8]</a></sup></sup>, and to state the arguments of Ahlu Sunna on the essence of God and his attributes, understanding of Qur’an.As well as there formed a manner of upholding opinion by performing ijthihad as a valid source of jurisprudence to acquire the rulings, which is not revealed in Quran and Sunna. At this period a lot of schools in jurisprudence and theology were created. Some of them uphold opinion more such as the schools at Kufa, especially Thowri and Hanafi schools; and some were regarding the both as same such as school of Shafie and Awza’i.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8">[9]</a></sup></sup></p><p>This was the way of Sahaba and Prophet (PBUH) was promoted them to do that if anything is not revealed in Qur’an and Sunna as Prophet (PBUH) asked to Mu’ad (R) when he sent into Yemen that “What if it is not in the Sunnah of the messenger of Allah?<strong>” .</strong>Then he replayed “Then, I will strive to form an opinion”<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9">[10]</a></sup></sup>. Prophet (PBUH) says:” If a judge makes a ruling, striving to apply his reasoning and he is correct, he will have two rewards. If a judge makes a ruling, striving to apply his reasoning and he is mistaken, he will have one reward”<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-10" id="footnote-ref-10">[11]</a></sup></sup>, the words reveal the acceptance of performing Ijthihad in Islam if it was wrong, but he have to work as he found by Ijthihad.</p><p>At the same time there was Mu’thazili school also which were presumed reason at the topper level of revelation in matters of religion. They considered opinion than Qur’an and Sunna.</p><p>While those all movement choose Iraq as their intellectual battle field, an another school contrary to all appeared in Iraq and they insisted on verbal understanding of the Qur’an and Sunnah.The school was found by a jurist named Dawud bn Ali. This was named as Literalists (Zahiriyyah) from the manner of school to acquire a ruling from wording of the revelation and not to the interpretation of it.</p><p><a id="_heading=h.lnxbz9"></a>2.3 EMERGENCE</p><p>The school was found by Dawud Al Zahir at Iraq in second century. But the ideology of upholding apparent meaning  was taken from the views of earlier figures such as Sufyan al-Thawri and Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh as the forerunners of Ẓāhirī principles, while this was point to Dawud al-Zahiri (815–883/4 CE) as the "founder" of the school<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-11" id="footnote-ref-11">[12]</a></sup></sup>.</p><p>The school was called initially as Dawudi School in the name of its founder after named as Zahiri as the school considers the apparent meaning of the word without interpreting it. The school attracted by many followers until the members of the madhhab were appointed as qadis in Baghdad, Shiraz, Isfahan, Firuzabad, Ramla, Damascus, Fustat, and Bukhara By the end of the 10th century.</p><p><a id="_heading=h.35nkun2"></a>2.4 EXPANSION IN WEST</p><p>While the school was developed in east, this was being introduced in the parts of North Africa by Maliki theologians, and then to Iberian Peninsula by any of the Dawud Al Zahir’s direct disciples<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-12" id="footnote-ref-12">[13]</a></sup></sup>.The school was more influenced in west than in east, where Zahiri School was developed parallel to other doctrines such as Maliki, Shafie, Hanafi and Hanbali. But in west there was no opponent to Zahiries without Maliki, So it could enjoy official support of Umayyad Caliphate<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-13" id="footnote-ref-13">[14]</a></sup></sup>.A lot Zahiri of Zahiri scholars appeared in the different parts of Iberian Peninsula since 9<sup>th</sup> Century.</p><p>Since the second century Westerns used to visit Madeena, Misr, and Baghdad in order to attain knowledge from eminent scholars of there. This intellectual relation between west and east brought the school to the west and Iberian Peninsula. This was brought firstly to Andulus by Dawud Al Zahir’s disciple ,Abdullah Ibn Muhammed bin Qasim bin Hilal (d.272)<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-14" id="footnote-ref-14">[15]</a></sup></sup>.He was a Maliki follower but became the disciple of Dawud Al Zahiri, after he went Andulus.</p><p>Another personality worked for spreading the school in west was Baqy bn Mukhlid who thought from Iraq, and ordered firstly to follow Qur’an and Sunna and to avoid others. He didn’t follow any schools and wasn’t the extreme supporter of Shafie, Hambali or Zahiri. He discouraged the imitation of any school. The both are those who strive for the establishment and spreading of the school at its early age on Andulas. The school became regarded by the arrival of Munzir Bin Saeen Al Baloothi (265-355 H). He taught from Zahiri scholars of east then came back and became Qadi of Qurthuba and Imam of masjid  Al Zahra’ of Qurthuba when the city of Al Zahra was the capital at the age of Abdur Rahman Al Nasir<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-15" id="footnote-ref-15">[16]</a></sup></sup>, he continued in this post until his death.he has a lot of works such as Ahkamul Qura’n and Annasikhu wal Mansookh.</p><p>Mas’ood bn Sulaiman who famous as Ibnu Mulfih the teacher of Ibn Hazm Al Zahiri, They caused the indignation of the Maliki jurists, so they started to claim that they were dangerous to the faith and they refused learning from him.</p><p><a id="_heading=h.1ksv4uv"></a>2.4 ZAHIRI AT THE AGE OF AL MOHAD</p><p>Ẓāhirī School enjoyed official state sponsorship by the rise of the Almohads.All Almohad leaders were extreme toward the Malikis their approach on Malikies were bad. The school spread throughout the west during the reign of Mansour Aba Yusuf, though people carried apparent meaning from the Qur’an and Sunnah. Since he was given the power Zahiri jurists was appointed as jurisdictions and examined those who criticized Ibn Hazm.</p><p>This hostility was between Mansour and the Maliki jurists and was not between Zahiris and Malikis. When Al-Mansur appointed an Zahiri judge, Ahmed bin Yazid bin Abd al-Rahman bin Baqi bin Mukhallad, who took over the district of Marrakesh and then Cordoba, which is his country of origin, and he ruled between those who contested his opinion of the two schools of thought, Maliki and Zahiri. This reveals there was no clashes between the scholars of two schools.</p><p>The rulers gave Ẓāhirīs and in a few of the Shafi‘is free rein to author works and run the judiciary. In the late 12th century, any religious material written by non-Ẓāhirīs was banned at first and burned later in Al Mohad Empire under the Almohad reforms. <sup><sup><a href="#footnote-16" id="footnote-ref-16">[17]</a></sup></sup></p><p><a id="_heading=h.44sinio"></a>2.5 METHODOLOGIES</p><p>Zahiri school regards only four as the evidence of Shari’ah as Ibn Hazm Al Zahiri said that “The principles on which nothing is known from Shari' except four, which is the text of the Noble Qur’an, the text of the words of the Messenger of God (PBUH) which is about God - the Almighty, peace and blessings be upon him, and the transmission of trusts, and the consensus of all the scholars of the community, and evidence of it is unbearable Only one side.”<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-17" id="footnote-ref-17">[18]</a></sup></sup>.</p><p>According to the words of Ibn Hazm Al Zahiri, there are four basic principles which jurisprudence is based on them, and those are:</p><p><strong>The Qur'an</strong>: It is the first principle of Sharia and its rest is recorded until the Day of Resurrection, and the Qur'an is either interpreted itself as the provisions of marriage, divorce, and inheritance, or it needs a statement from Sunnah, such as detailing the overall meaning of prayer, zakat and Hajj</p><p><strong>THE SUNNAH</strong>: Al-Zahiriyya divides the Sunnah into two parts:</p><p><strong>FREQUENTLY REPORTED HADEETH</strong> (Muthawathir) and it is an absolute argument without hesitation. And their condition to determine that the minimum number reporters have to be in a Muthawathir is two if they are guaranteed that they do not let to lie.</p><p><strong>AHAAD</strong> , action and belief in the this kind of Sunnah is must. Then the difference between the two kinds of Hadees is when two of them are contradict Muthawathir will regarded when reasoning (Isthidlal)</p><p><strong>CONSENSUS</strong>: Zahiri scholars consider this as what was done in the era of the Companions as that was possible that age, though they did not take consensus. Because the agreement of the entire jurist is impossible in their view.</p><p><strong>PRESUMPTION OF CONTINUITY (ISTHISHAB)</strong>: Zahiri School agrees that the basis of everything is to be permissible except what was prohibited by the text. The Almighty said when Adam descended to the earth: “And for you on the earth is a place of settlement and enjoyment for a time” God Almighty permitted to use every things by saying that they are our goods, and those are permissible basically</p><p>Zahiriyya avoids analogy (Qiyas) as that is determining of ruling by opinion so that will oppose the textual rulings. This led their jurisprudent to include some strange rulings as Ibn Hazm said that the urine of a human will impure the stagnant water, but the urine of other animals wouldn’t make the stagnant water impure if the animal was the pig. As well as Zahiries finds the saliva of dog is impure and the pot touch that must wash with soil and water seven times. But the Hukm is not applicable on pig but their view is the saliva of pig is pure.</p><p>But there is no doubt that the lack regarding Qiyas would be difficult in most of rulings. Because the simple logic states that bearing the ruling of anything on similar thing is necessary<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-18" id="footnote-ref-18">[19]</a></sup></sup>.</p><p><a id="_heading=h.2jxsxqh"></a>CHAPTER THREE: DAWUD AL ZAHIRI AND SCHOLARS WHO, WORK FOR THE SCHOOL</p><p><a id="_heading=h.z337ya"></a>3.1 INDRODUCTION</p><p>Between the second and eighth century there formed a lot of schools in all sects of Islam in both of theology and jurisprudence. Such as in  Ahlu Sunna also founded a lot of schools like Hanafi, Maliki, Shafie, Hanbali, Zahiri, Awza’I, Thouri etc. four of them revived and other became collapsed by lack of followers , scholars to develop the school and many other reasons. Zahiri doctrine collapsed after it has existed about centuries. Though it have a lot of eminent scholars who had developed the school and they performed Ijthihad to develop the doctrine to deal newly formed issues as well as they made some additions to basic of the school. Such as his son Abu Bakr Muhammad Ibn Dawud and Ibn Hazm Al Zahiri.</p><p>This chapter discusses about scholars in Zahiri doctrine especially their biography and then on the views of some. Zahiri doctrine was active in east in its early age and later at west part such as Islamic Andulus. There will discuss scholars of both in east and in west.</p><p><a id="_heading=h.3j2qqm3"></a>3.2 THE ZAHIRITE SCHOOL IN EAST</p><p><a id="_heading=h.1y810tw"></a>3.2.1 DAWUD AL ZAHIRI</p><p>The founder of Zahiri doctrine who belonged to Kashan, a town in the neighborhood of Isfahan.He was born in Kufah in 202/817. His father was a secretary (Katib) to Abd Allah ibn Khalid, judge of Isfahan, in the age of the Caliph al‑Mamun. Later his family moved to Baghdad, where he was brought up, taught, and established the school of jurisprudence which, was titeled in his name as Madhab_al_dawoodi whether it was famoused as Zahiri Madhab. He attended many lectures of eminent jurists at Baghdad from. The pre-eminent jurist of them is Abu Thaur (d. 246/860), a follower of Shafi’e. This made him shifted from Hanafite School to Shafi’e shool, which the most of lectures at Baghdad was Shafi’e followers. He made his education perfect by meat Ishaq ibn Rahawaih, a Shafie follower, of Naisaboor. He was a God‑fearing,pious, and ascetic.He was accused as he believes that Qur’an is the creation of Allah and that is not eternal but this is only a accused on him <sup><sup><a href="#footnote-19" id="footnote-ref-19">[20]</a></sup></sup>. He died in 270/884 in Baghdad.</p><p>He was a writer also. Ibn al‑Nadim enumerates about one hundred and fifty titles of his books<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-20" id="footnote-ref-20">[21]</a></sup></sup>.A little books of him covers Usool, consensus and Qiyas.most of his books deals branches of Fiqh. Unfortunatly none of his book is available now.</p><p>He founded the school, the Zahirite School, which regards the Qur'an and the Hadith as the only sources of jurisprudence. He accepted consensus (Ijma`) of the Companions of the Prophet, but he rejected analogy (Qiyas), Istihsan, and imitation (Taqlid) of any scholar. </p><p><a id="_heading=h.4i7ojhp"></a>3.2.2 MUHAMMAD BIN DAWUD AL-ZAHIRI (C. 255/869‑297/910)</p><p>Abū Bakr Muḥammad ibn Dāwūd al-Iṣbahānī, son of Dawud Al Zahiri founder of Zahiri School.

Ibn Dawud chooses Baghdad to teach as his father. When he was fifteen years old, he was considered as an outstanding jurist. Ibn Dawud is generally considered to have died young in 297 Hijri.</p><p>VIEWS</p><p>Ibn Dawud was an opponent of using analogical reason (Qiyas) and juristic preference in jurisprudence, which was the same views were held by his father. In theology Ibn Dawud did not left any theological works which have survived like his father Dawed but he was well known to have been involved in public debates with the Mu'tazila in the court of Caliph Al Muwaffaq. He was hostile toward Sufism, especially Sufi metaphysics. He declared Hallaj as a heretic</p><p>WORKS</p><p>He has a lot of works Zahiri jurisprudence as well as in othrer fields.

By the fall of the Umayyad Caliphate in Cordova (422) and the assassination of Hisham III made life unbearable on him. The only one way in front of him was to stay on the island of Majorca. The local Governor of Majorca was Abu al‑`Abbas Ahmad ibn Rashiq, he was a man of letters and able statesman, who invited Ibn Hazm for a sojourn on the island.Ibn Hazm took refuge there and began propagation of Zahirism.</p><p>When he was supported by the Governor, some Majorcans followed the School. But the famous Maliki jurist, Abu al‑Walid al Baji (403-474) held a debates with Ibn Hazm when he returned from a journey in the East and this caused his disgrace.Ibn Hazm obliged to leave the island and back to the mainland, finally he  stayed in Manta Lisham where he passed away.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-24" id="footnote-ref-24">[25]</a></sup></sup></p><p><a id="_heading=h.2bn6wsx"></a>WORKS</p><p>Ibn Hazm was a writer on different kinds subjects.

Really Zahirism worked as a jurisprudent school in East, but in Spain this spread nothing without prosecuted philosophies, which set out to decline by the death of Ibn Hazm.his views was only given the acceptance of Western Muslims. He was not given any influence on East at all.</p><p>Zahiriats of East and Hanabilats were fond of following Dawud bn Ali, by the cause a little of Zahiri jurisprudent laws reached us. The few attempts of propagation Zahirism in North Africa were due to some political considerations. In Andulus they was given supports from here and there.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-28" id="footnote-ref-28">[29]</a></sup></sup></p><p>Al‑Humaidi one of the historian, biographer and contemporarian of Bin Hazm. He was a declared Zahirite. When the tribulation of the followers of the Zahirite School reached a high level in Muslim Spain, he left his native land, went to the East, and settled down in Baghdad where he died there forty years later. Al‑Humaidi introduced Ibn Hazm's works into the East firstly, but there they made no impact on the work of Ibn Hazm in East. But beyond of all persecution Zahirism had a numerous followers for a certain period as Ibn al‑Athir sayed ‘There was in the Muslim West a multitude of them (of the Zahirites) called the Hazmiyyah or followers of Ibn Hazm’<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-29" id="footnote-ref-29">[30]</a></sup></sup>. With the advance of the sixth/twelfth century, Zahirism became a trouble in the Muslim West, in Spain, and in North Africa.</p><p><a id="_heading=h.1pxezwc"></a>4.2 VIEWS OF SUNNI SHOLARS ON ZAHIRI DOCTRINE</p><p>Maliki and Sahfie scholars have expressed negative feelings regarding the Ẓāhirī School. Followers of the Shafi‘i school within Sunni Islam (both are the school of Sunni Islam) have been involved in intellectual conflict with Ẓāhirīs all over its history.The view of  most prominent jurists of Shafie school Imam Haramayn -Al Juwaini- and Al-Nawawi considered the Zahirite school entirely invalid<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-30" id="footnote-ref-30">[31]</a></sup></sup>. Al-Dhahabi and Ibn al-Salah never agreed the Ẓāhirī teachings<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-31" id="footnote-ref-31">[32]</a></sup></sup>.</p><p> Abu Bakr ibn al-Arabi, whose father was a Ẓāhirī, But he considered Ẓāhirī law to be foolish. Ibn 'Abd al-Barr, another scholar who was himself a former Ẓāhirī follower, excluded Dawud al-Ẓāhirī along with Ahmad ibn Hanbal from his book on Sunni Islam's greatest jurists. Ẓāhirīs such as Ibn Hazm and others were attacked and challenged intellectually by Maliki jurists after their deaths.</p><p>The flow of people to Zahiri School at the age of Muwahhid dynasty, who lit up the books of other schools, is assumed as that was not to return to Quran and Sunna but that was to propagate Zahiri thoughts among people to attain other purposes as Abdullah Al Khanoon said in his book Al Nuboogul Magribi fi Adabil Arabi that this is true that “the ruler Ya’qoob didn’t call the people to the views of Dawud Al Zahiri , Ibn Hazm or any of Zahiri jurist and he didn’t planned to publish any book of Zahiri”. Imam Marraqishi denote an incident happened there at the age of Muwahhid ruler in his book Al Mu’jib that was about a day, scholar became frightened and Books without Qur’an and Hadees were lit up.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-32" id="footnote-ref-32">[33]</a></sup></sup></p><p>The contemporary jurists of Dawud ibn 'Ali tried to criticize him and his school well. The Shafi'ites in general criticized him several times and Shafi' scholars regarded the Zahirite school as worthless. Al‑Isfara'ini (d. 418/1027) maintained that nothing would be acceptable from the Zahirites by they rejected analogy ( qiyas ), he avowed that, they could not have been able to exercise judgment, to perform Ijthihad and, So, nobody of them would be considered to the position of a judge (Qadi). Some others assumed that Dawud ibn `Ali was a ignorant<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-33" id="footnote-ref-33">[34]</a></sup></sup>.Ẓāhirī School does not support Sufism and the relation between them was very complicated, throughout its history, its followers have always clashes and criticize Sufism as well this included some of Sufis. One of the old Dawud’s followers was Ruwaym b. Amad ,A Sufi saint, who died in 303.And Dawud Zahiri was one of the Sufi saint himself.</p><p><a id="_heading=h.49x2ik5"></a>4.2.1 SHAFIE SCHOLARS ON ZAHIRI DOCTRINE</p><p>Shafii scholars Abu Ishaq Al Isfiraeeni, Imam Al Haramaini and Imam Al Gazzali are not regarding Zahiri contraindications<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-34" id="footnote-ref-34">[35]</a></sup></sup>.Qadi Abu Baker Baqilani says:”The Zahiri scholars are not Scholar of Sahree’a but thery are only the transmitters if they are trustworthy”<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-35" id="footnote-ref-35">[36]</a></sup></sup>.Imam Navai says :the divergence of Dawud Al Zahiri wouldn’t make any difficult in the acceptance of Ijma’ which was agreed by most of the scholars. As well as a Mujthahid of School must have not imitate any other, but his doctrine is affiliated the school of Iman Al Safie.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-36" id="footnote-ref-36">[37]</a></sup></sup></p><p><a id="_heading=h.2p2csry"></a>CONCLUTION</p><p>Between second and eighth century there formed a lot schools in theology and jurisprudence in every sects of Islam such as Shiya, Mu’thazila and in Ahlu Sunna.Four of Ahlu Sunnah schools survived when other schools were coincided by various causes such as lake of followers and scholars to develop the school after them. Beyond of those four doctrines Zahiri doctrine survived more time firstly at east by its foundation at Iraq and then at Islamic Spain. The doctrine was named as its principle is to follow the apparent word meaning of Qur’an and Hadeeth. They rejects Qiyas, Isthihsn, other logical principles of Sharee’a, and they supports Ijma’ but they argues that is not possible after the era of companion.</p><p>Zahiri School was spread in east and west by two scholars one was its founder Ibn Hazm Al Zahiri who was the founder of the school at Iraq. Though the doctrine was famous as Dawudi doctrine and later it famous in its strange principle. And the another one was Ibn Hazm Al Zahiri who spread the doctrine at Islamic Spain, he is assumed as he tried to mix up philosophical thoughts in Zahiri Madhab</p><ol><li id="footnote-0"><p><strong> </strong>Ibn_Hazm:A Spanish scholar who followed Zahiri doctrines and have many contributions in this doctrine <a href="#footnote-ref-0">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-1"><p> <a href="#footnote-ref-1">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-2"><p> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zahirism <a href="#footnote-ref-2">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-3"><p> www.ibnamin.com/Manhaj/Zahiri <a href="#footnote-ref-3">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-4"><p> wikipedia <a href="#footnote-ref-4">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-5"><p> Shahrasthani ; From the research Zaharism by Omar A.
